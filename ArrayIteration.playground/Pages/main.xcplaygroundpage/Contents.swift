/*: question1
 ### 1. You're building an app and want to store all of the ingredients added to a cart into an `Array`. The ingredients are "Chips", "Salsa", "Guacamole", and "Red wine". Name this `Array` variable whatever you like, think of a name which makes sense.
 */
// write your code here
var cart = ["Chips", "Salsa", "Guacamole", "Red wine"]





/*: question2
 ### 2. You need to create a list that contains the numbers from 1 to 10. How would you represent this list in code?
 */
// write your code here
var oneToTen = [1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]






/*: question3
 ### 3. Take the list of numbers you created in question 2 and print their values in the most efficient way possible. (Hint: for-in loop).
 */
// write your code here
for number in oneToTen {
    print("\(number)")
}






/*: question4
 ### 4. Take the list of shopping cart items you created in question 1 and iterate through it printing each item to the console.
 */
// write your code here
for shopping in cart {
    print("\(shopping)")
}






/*: question5
 ### 5. Create a function that takes an array of names and greets each person with the following message "Good morning x" <- x being the individuals name. One caveat. If the persons first name is Michael, we want to greet them with the message, "Top of the morning Michael!".
 */
// write your code here
func greeting (names: [String]) {
    for name in names {
        print("Good morning \(name)")
        
        if name == "Michael" {
            print("Top of the moring \(name)")
        }
    }
}




/*: question6
 ### 6. Create a function that takes an array of Ints and returns an array of Ints. This function should look through the array of Ints and create a new array of Ints that only contain integers less than 50.
 */
// write your code here
func lessThanFifty (numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
    var result: [Int] = []
    for number in numbers {
        if number < 50 {
            result.append(number)
        }
    }
    return result
}
